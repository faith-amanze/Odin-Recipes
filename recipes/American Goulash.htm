<h2>Description</h2>
<p>American goulash was one of my all-time favorite comfort 
    food meals when I was growing up. 
    They served it in my school cafeteria alongside a slice of 
    buttered white bread and a carton of milk. </p>
    <p>This Americanized version of goulash was invented to stretch a 
    small amount of beef into enough food for a not-so-small family. 
    It's a simple dish that doesn't taste simple,
    so it's perfect for your weeknight dinner rotation.</p>
