<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I made this up one day when I couldn't find a recipe anywhere with these ingredients. 
    So I kind of threw it together on a whim. Sugar can be adjusted for sweetness,</p>
<p>and if the sauce gets a bit thicker than desired I suggest adding a 
     little chicken broth as it's thickening. Serve immediately over rice </p>
